Pagination and Content Filter

Enhancing the usability of a web page that has too much information. To make it easier to find information and read the page, must use progressive enhancement to add pagination.

The page includes a list of 54 students. Display 10 students per page, and add buttons to jump between the lists of 10 students.

Solution should work for any number of student listings, whether there were 5, 25, 55 or 100 student listings.

Optionally feature: Add a search bar to let users search the list of students for a particular student or students.

Use javascript and/or jQuery for this project, avoid using plugins to achieve the pagination and/or search functionality.
